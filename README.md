# Hotel-Management-Sample
A brief python tool for checking in/checking out of a hotel

This hotel management tool demonstrates simple use-cases with Python. A user can choose to "check in" or "check out" and will be prompted to do several things:

A. Check In

What floor/room number
Number of occupants
Names of occupants
This data will then be populated into a dictionary, storing the key/value pairs.

B. Check Out

What room number
If room number exists, delete the record
Dictionary will refresh.

There is also an added shutdown tool for hotel management, that can be used when program no longer needs to be run. Otherwise, it will continue to refresh for the next guest.
